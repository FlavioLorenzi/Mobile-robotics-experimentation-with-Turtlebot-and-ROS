# Mobile-robotics-experimentation-with-Turtlebot-and-ROS
Bachelor's degree (computer engineering) subject: Turtlebot (mobile robot) programming with Python, Matlab and ROS.

Several important topics of Robotics and AI are managed (e.g. odometry check, obstacle detection and avoidance, SLAM) and several tools are used for (e.g. Rviz, Gazebo, Arduino with infrared sensor, Optitrack system)
